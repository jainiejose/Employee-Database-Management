# Employee Database Management
**Introduction**

After trying various online SQL tutorials, I wanted to test my knowledge by working on a new dataset and try my hacking skills on some SQL queries. In this project, I created my own dataset. My interest in creating this dataset is based on my previous work experience back at ShopBack where I was working as an HR professional. [ShopBack](https://www.shopback.sg/) is a Singapore based ecommerce loyalty platform serving over 30 million shoppers across 9 markets in Asia Pacific.  

## **About the dataset** 


I created two tables of employee information and uploaded the information onto different files and used MS SQL to practice my queries.

(1) Employee Demographics

(2) Employee Salary



## Table of contents:
| Title of the File | Description |
|--- | --- |
|Employee details for demographics| Employees details created for the table
|Employee salary details| Employee salaries created for the table
|Basic SQL Queries| Includes: (1) Count, select and distinct function (2) Aggregation functions: Group by, Min, Max, Sum & Avg |    
|Intermediate SQL Queries| Includes: Inner join, full outer join, left outer join, right outer join, aliasing, partition by, ntile, percent rank |
|Advanced SQL Queries | Includes: (1) Common table expressions (2) String functions: Trim, Ltrim and replace|
