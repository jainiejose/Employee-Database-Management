# SQL Query
**Introduction**

After trying various online SQL tutorials, I wanted to test my knowledge by working on a new dataset and try my hacking skills on some SQL queries. In this project, I created my own dataset using some of the employee information from this Kaggle dataset. My interest in creating this dataset is based on my previous work experience back at ShopBack where I was working as an HR professional. [ShopBack](https://www.shopback.sg/) is a Singapore based ecommerce loyalty platform serving over 30 million shoppers across 9 markets in Asia Pacific.

## **About the dataset** 


I created two tables for practicing my SQL queries and uploaded the information on a different file.

(1) EmployeeDemographics
(2) EmployeeSalary


## **Installation and setup**

- We're going to be using SQLite which is a database engine that works in a single application. In order to access it we'll be using DBeaver. DBeaver is an open-source database manager that connects to almost all database engines. When downloading, select the [**DBeaver community only**](https://dbeaver.io/download/).
