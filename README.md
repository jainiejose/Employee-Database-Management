# SQL Queries
**Introduction**

After trying various online SQL tutorials, I wanted to test my knowledge by working on a new dataset and try my hacking skills on some SQL queries. In this project, I created my own dataset using some of the employee information from this Kaggle dataset. My interest in creating this dataset is based on my previous work experience back at ShopBack where I was working as an HR professional. [ShopBack](https://www.shopback.sg/) is a Singapore based ecommerce loyalty platform serving over 30 million shoppers across 9 markets in Asia Pacific.  

## **About the dataset** 


I created two tables for practicing my SQL queries and uploaded the information onto different files.

(1) Employee Demographics

(2) Employee Salary



## Table of contents:
| Title of the File | Description |
|--- | --- |
|Employee details for Demographics| Employees details created for the table
|Employee salary details| Employee salaries created for the table
|Basic SQL Queries| Includes: (1) Count, select and distinct function (2) Aggregation functions: Group by, Min, Max,Sum & Avg|    
|Intermediate SQL Queries| Includes: Inner join, full outer join, left outer join, right outer join, aliasing, partition by, ntile, percent rank |
|Advanced SQL Queries | Includes: (1) Common table expression (2) String functions: Trim,Ltrim and replace|
